            <h1> Tony Stark </h1>
            <p> Tony Stark is the extremely wealthy inventor engineer, and CEO of Stark industries. He is the son of Howard Stark, the weapons manufacturer who revolutionised arms technology. Since he was young, Ton;ys brilliant mind grew more curious in creating technology, and eventually he inherited his Stark industries when his parents were killed. Tony continued to design and develop weapons of war for his company. 

              While consulting on a weapons contract overseas in enemy terrain, an explosive devise detonated underneath his transport vehicle, bringing him close to death. The explosion sent a piece of shrapnel just inches from his heart. Fortunately for tony, fellow inventor and engineer Yinsen inserted a device into Tony’s chest that would keep him alive. 
              While being forced to build weapons for his captor, he created an iron suit that would help him escape.             
            </p>
            <h2> Iron Man </h2>
            <p>
              Since building this first suit in the cave, Tony designed and developed many new suits in the years following. He would test them out on himself, sometimes injuring himself or blowing up sections of his laboratory, but he was determined to perfect his suit. In the end he created 85 suits, all with slightly upgraded specifications and modifications. 
            </p>
            <h3> Suit Specifications </h3>
              <ul> 
                <li> Arc Reactor: The  suit is red and gold themed, powered by the arc reactor in Tony Stark’s chest, which is based on ‘unfinished technology’ first designed by his father Howard Stark and Anton Vanko, which Tony modified into a chest piece. </li>
                <li> The suit is the most resilient armor created by Tony, allowing him to withstand attacks from Thanos, and could contain all of the infinity stones, allowing Stark to harness their collective power.</li>
                <li> The suit has booster jets that allow Stark to fly fast enough to break the sound barrier, and maneuver more quickly than a fighter jet. </li>
                <li> His helmet has a 360 degree vision, and access to his computer persona ‘Jarvis’ who he can consult with directly while on missions. It also has a heads up display which allows him to analyze the environment and see through walls</li>
                <li> The suit has repulsors that can both fire high-intensity energy beams and fly at incredible speeds.</li> 
                <li> All the armors have a unibeam - capable of firing an energy blast from the centre</li>
                <li> Energy shield - functions to create blue hard-light shield (similar to Wakanda’s energy cloaks) for protection.</li>
                <li> Suit materialisation allows the suit to literally materialise around him within seconds by pressing the arc reactor core on his chest. </li>
              </ul>
